       <h2>Swift Netrek Client Credits</h2>
        <p>
        <h3>Netrek History</h3>
        XTrek is the original Internet team game, originally developed for Unix Workstations running X windows in 1986 by Chris Guthrie.  This was only 3 years after IP version 4 was deployed (January 1st 1983) and long before the invention of the "graphical web browser".  Netrek was a drastically improved version of Xtrek developed in 1989 by Kevin P Smith and Scott Silvey.  See http://www.netrek.org/about/history_overall.php for a more detailed history.  Chris, Kevin, and Scott made XTrek and Netrek "open source" with a very lenient copyright notice.  This allowed Netrek client and server development to proceed for decades to new platforms, window systems, and languages.
        <p>
        In accordance with the debt to open source software, using the Swift Netrek Client is free.  The source code will be made publically available on GitHub as soon as Apple approves the client for the MacOS App Store.
        <p>
        <h3>Programmer</h3>
        The Swift Netrek client is written by Darrell Root for Network Mom LLC.  Check out https://networkmom.net/netrek for more information.  While the client and source code are free, please consider leaving a positive app review in the MacOS App Store or a tip (by in-app purchase).
        <p>
        <h3>Programming Language and environment</h3>
        The Swift Netrek client is written in.......Swift!  The new programming language from Apple.  Chris Lattner, formerly of Apple, was the originator and leader of the Swift project.
        <p>
        Netrek uses the new "Network" framework from Apple.  This is a new API to originate TCP and UDP sockets.  It is noticably easier to use than the old BSD socket API.
        <p>
        Netrek uses SpriteKit for displaying graphics in the tactical map.

            <li>175270__jonccox__gun-zap.wav (used for detonate)
        </ul>
        The following other sounds were used from freesound.org under the Creative Commons Attribution License or the Creative Commons 0 License:

            <dd>71852__ludvique__digital-whoosh-soft.wav
        </dl>
        <h3>Graphics</h3>
        The planet icons were made by Darrell Root based on screenshots of the original COW client from the 1990's
        <p>
        The Roman (redfleet), Kazari (greenfleet) and Orion (blueFleet) ship icons came originally came from Artist Pascal Gagnon via the Gytha Netrek Client under the Creative Commons Attribution License.
        <p>
        The Federation(outlineFleet), and Independent (also outlineFleet) ship icons came from the MacTrek 1.5 client (written in Objective C in 2006) by Chris and Judith Lukassen.  Judith did the artwork.
        <p>
        <h3>Prior Netrek Client: Mac Trek</h3>
        Chris and Judith Lukassen wrote Mac Trek in Objective C around 2006.  While the Swift Netrek Client does not use any of their source code, I learned much about both Netrek and programming from their code.
        <h3>Prior Netrek Client: Gytha</h3>
        James Cameron (aka Quozl) wrote the Gytha netrek client in 2012.  Implemented in Python, we used the code as a resource during our development.  James Cameron helpfully answered several questions during our development.
        <h3>Prior Netrek Client: BRMH</h3>
        Developed in C in the 1990's we also used this client as a resource during development.  There are too many developers of BRMH so we refer you to http://www.netrek.org/files/archive/BRMH/BRMH.html for more information.
        <h3>Netrek Vanilla Server</h3>
        We used the Netrek Vanilla Server (written in C, maintained by James Cameron) as a reference during development.  We used packets.h from this distribution to specify a few Struct formats we could not specify in Swift.  See https://github.com/quozl/netrek-server for more information.
        <h3>Netrek Hints</h3>
        Many of the advanced hints on the tactical screen came from the Windows netrek client courtesy of Bill Balcerski.
