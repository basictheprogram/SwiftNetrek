            <content style="Normal">There is no “friendly fire” in Netrek.  It is not possible to directly affect your teammates with your weapons.  Ship and plasma explosions, however, can result in damage to friendly ships.  So don’t fire plasma near your starbase and try not to blow up on your starbase.</content>

            <content style="Normal">Torpedoes are the most commonly used weapon in the game.  They do 25 to 40 points of damage depending on firing ship type.  Torpedo damage does not decrease with range.  Enemy ships can dodge torpedoes or detonate them (d) at a distance for partial damage if it looks like being hit is inevitable.  This costs 100 fuel. </content>

            <content style="Normal">You can only have 8 torpedoes on the map at a time.  You can detonate your own torpedoes (D).  They do not do any damage when self-detonated, but it lets you fire a new volley of 8 more torpedoes immediately.</content>

            <content style="Normal">Torpedoes are fired by pressing or dragging the left mouse button.  A torpedo can be fired every 0.1 seconds (this usually requires mouse dragging).</content>

            <content style="Normal">Lasers are fired with the center mouse button.  They cannot be dodged, but you can miss due to poor aim or “network lag”.  They take part of a second to recharge (starbase lasers recharge twice as fast and are very lethal).  Maximum damage ranges from 75 (scout) to 120 (starbase).  Laser damage decreases dramatically with range.  Lasers can also be used to detonate enemy plasmas, although that requires skill.</content>

            <content style="Normal">Once you achieve 2 kills, you can go back to your home planet or friendly starbase and launch a new ship (refit).  This adds plasma weapons to your ship.   Plasma’s fire from the front of the ship, will automatically adjust their course towards the nearest enemy ship.  They inflict a lot of damage.   But they can be shot with enemy lasers (resulting in a damaging explosion, possibly close to your ship).  Enemy robot players reliably shoot plasma, so don’t shoot plasma at robots.  Plasmas also generate a lot of weapons heat.  Plasmas appear to be large torpedoes (2 x width, 2 x height).</content>

            <content style="Normal">“Sturgeon” servers also support “missiles”, which are homing torpedoes that can be shot down with lasers.  This client does not currently support displaying or firing missiles.  Fortunately, only “refitted” enemy ships have the missile upgrade.</content>

            <content style="Normal">When a ship blows up it does damage to friendly and enemy ships in the vicinity.  Sometimes blowing up on your enemy is your final act of defiance.  A suicidal charge at an enemy in an attempt to destroy it at any cost is called an “Ogg”.  See a Netrek history website for the reason why.</content>

            <content style="Normal">Each time you fire a weapon, your weapon temperature increases.  If you weapon temperature overheats, you cannot fire weapons while it cools down.  This is rare for normal ships to encounter, but staircases can suffer weapon overheating during extended battles.  Especially if it is firing plasma.</content>
