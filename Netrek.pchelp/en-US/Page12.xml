            <content style="Normal">While Netrek is an intense team game, make sure to have fun.  There are always players better or (once you get a bit of practice) worse than you.  The robots are pretty good (much better than the 1991 robots) so donâ€™t be frustrated while learning.  Be friendly to your teammates and opposing players.</content>
