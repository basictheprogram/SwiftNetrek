            <content style="Normal">Hit c to toggle your cloaking device.  You will be invisible on the tactical map.  You will show up as ?? on the strategic map.  If you are further than 1/7th the galaxy size away from the nearest enemy, you will not be visible on the galactic map at all (this lets you sneak up on enemy planets from neutral space).  You cannot fire weapons while cloaked, but you can orbit, bomb, and beam armies to enemy planets.</content>

            <content style="Normal">You can toggle your tractor beam with the T key.  This can pull friendly or enemy ships towards you.  This can pull an (uncloaked) enemy ship out of orbit, preventing it from capturing a planet.  It can also keep an enemy ship from escaping or dodging effectively while you fire your weapons at it.</content>

            <content style="Normal">You can toggle your pressor beam with the y key.  This can prevent enemy ships from getting too close to you, or push enemy planet takers out of orbit.  Starbases often use pressor beam when under heavy attack.</content>

            <content style="Normal">When in orbit around an enemy planet, you can hit b to bomb the planet.  This is only effective when the planet has more than 4 armies.  Keep in mind that enemy planets do damage to you when you are close.  Assault ships are very effective at bombing large numbers of enemy armies.  Scouts destroy fewer armies when bombing but can be useful suppressing enemy army production in their rear planets.</content>

            <content style="Normal">Planets with more than 4 armies are slightly larger on the strategic map, and have a person icon on the tactical map.</content>

        <line Align="Left">
            <content style="Normal">Planets add armies at random intervals.  “AGRI” planets add armies more frequently.  Armies with fewer than 4 armies add armies more frequently, until they reach 4.  It is possible that a planet will “pop” additional armies while under attack.  This makes it theoretically possible to fail to capture a planet after bombing and beaming down 5 armies.</content>

            <content style="Normal">You can beam up friendly armies by using the z key while orbiting a friendly planet.  You can only beam up “surplus” armies (armies greater than 4).  You can carry at most 2 armies per kill.  Ships also have army carry limits (for example, scouts can only carry 2 armies).  In general, you rarely want to carry more than 5 armies because (with bombing) 5 armies is sufficient to capture any planet.  If your ship is destroyed while carrying armies, the armies are also destroyed.</content>

            <content style="Normal">You can beam down armies by using the x key while orbiting a friendly planet, enemy planet, or while docked with a friendly starbase.  Each army beamed down to an enemy planet dies while killing an enemy army on the planet.  If you kill all the enemy armies the planet becomes neutral.  If you beam down 1 additional army to a neutral planet, you capture the planet.</content>
