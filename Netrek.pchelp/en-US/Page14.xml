            <content style="Normal">XTrek was developed for Unix Workstations running the X Window system in 1986 by Chris Guthrie (only 3 years after IP version 4 was deployed on January 1st 1983, and long before the invention of the “graphical web browser”).  XTrek ran on one large server with multiple players “remote displayed” on Unix Workstations over a LAN.  WAN play was not practical because the entire graphical display was transmitted over the network.  XTrek had one ship type and up to 3 torpedoes per ship.</content>

            <content style="Normal">Netrek was originally implemented in C for Unix Workstations  in 1989 by Kevin P Smith and Scott Silvey.  Netrek used a client-server model with a “Netrek Server” running on one workstation and multiple clients connecting to the server.  Netrek very efficiently minimized the amount of data to be transmitted over the network, allowing International network play over the Internet, despite the relatively small bandwidth WAN links of the time.</content>

            <content style="Normal">Both XTrek and Netrek had very lenient public domain copyright notices.  Over the years, Netrek was gradually improved (short and generic packets optimizations) and modified (Paradise and Sturgeon variants).  Netrek clients were implemented for different platforms (Microsoft Windows, Mac) and in different languages (Python, HTML5, and now Swift).  Many programmers learned network and game programming on Netrek and went on to program for some of the largest corporations on the planet.</content>

            <content style="Normal">While this Swift Netrek Client does not use source code from any prior client (wrong language) it uses the API’s from the original Netrek.  In accordance with our debt to this open source software, the Swift Netrek client is free to play and the code will be open sourced.</content>
