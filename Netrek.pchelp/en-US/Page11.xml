            <content style="Normal">Once you are in tournament mode, you will earn “Damage Inflicted” with every ship killed, every army bombed, and every planet captured.  Sufficient damage inflicted, plus a high enough offense rating (damage inflicted per hour) will result in “promotions” to higher rank.  If you are not playing as a guest, these promotions will persist to future games on the same server.</content>
